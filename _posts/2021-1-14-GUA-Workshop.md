**Workshop Notes for GUA**

www.grinderuberairbnb.exposed Workshop Description:



This workshop will explore the network as a tool for collective movement. The workshop will begin with an overview of www.grindruberairbnb.exposed, an exploratory project for leading groups of participants in synchronized action via their mobile phones. The workshop will explore how the sequences of actions are created, and invite a moment of collaboration and exploration with the participants, to create a sequence of actions that we will all perform together. After the performance, we will discuss the experience of performing the work, as well as the conceptual implications of the work.

What we want the workshop to do: 

Option 1:

Workshop about GUA - showing people how it works, speaking about the conceptual structures of it, revealing where I think the work falls short, discussing what is good about it, what's not; speaking about UI design, about behavioural modification, about the army of people working behind the scenes to capture attention. 

Demonstrating how sequences are made, and collaboratively creating a sequence that we will perform together. The workshop will also touch on research I've done into systems that support collaboration and collective action, such as turn-together and left-right, and raise the larger question of what value is gained by large-scale works as opposed to more condensed ideas. 

The workshop can also touch on the 

Talking with Lucas: the white male desire for control, which is embodied in the technocratic drive; the work embodies it perfectly, but does that make it a good work? How to gain criticality, how to gain critical distance to this idea? Can we just enact something and say that it's good? 

The workshop will be a process where we debate whether the idea is good, and explore what might be done with the idea. 

What can be done in a workshop?



During this workshop we'll explore the physical and conceptual possibilities for collective motion in networked bodies, through a series of web-based explorations. We'll start with an introduction to this area of research, centering around the project  'www.grindruberairbnb.exposed'. We'll then collectively create a sequence of actions and perform these together, and reflect on the experience of moving together through the network. We'll explore further systems that allow the group to collectively determine, during the performance, how they wish to act, and reflect on these possibilities. We'll close with a discussion about the conceptual and practical possibilites of this research. 

After reflecting on this experience, we'll explore other systems that allow a group to perform and act together. 

 We'll create and perform a short choreography via this system, and then explore some more experimental iterations on this idea, using systems that allow the group to collectively make decisions on how to act.
