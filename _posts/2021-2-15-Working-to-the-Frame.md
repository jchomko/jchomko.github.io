**Working to the Frame**

In my bio I write that I'm exploring the dynamic between the physical and digital worlds. I like to think of this not only as the physical phenomena that traverse these worlds, but also the mental and psychological effects of our digital / physical selves. 

I generally try to be very aware of how technology shapes my behaviour, and take steps to avoid the effects of technology on my behaviour. I have software blockers on my phone and computers, that allow certain sites to be accessed at certain times, and I have two phones; one with all my fun/social/dating stuff, and the other that's just for 'work' that I carry around with me. I can put the fun phone away, and I don't take it out with me when I go places; this means that I'm not always carrying around a device that I use to distract myself. 

But these strategies are only patchwork; I still need to keep up a practice of meditation and exercise to maintain a good mental balance. 

Social platforms like instagram, where I go to share updates on my projects, have an effect on me beyond my direct usage. In times of frequent updating, I conceptualize instagram posts in my head as I go througout my day. 

I've started to think of this conceptualization process as 'working to the frame'; that I'm fitting my communicative impulses to fit the frame of instagram, rather than express them in their most ideal form. Expanding this idea from social media platforms, it becomes clear that we're always working to some sort of frame when creating art. Even writing this post, I'm working to a linguistic frame. 

I dislike the idea of working to the frame on instagram; it makes me feel like I have melded so closely with the platform that any idea few new work will necessarily be affected by the platform. There is a robust discussion about social media engagement as labour, and I think this frame helps elucidate that argument. 

The difference between creating a post on instagram and creating a painting are interesting to consider. The image ratio and size are defined on instagram, and there is also a temporal dimension. You can play within the rules of instagram; I recall a great series of linked and tagged accounts that really played with the  structure and motivations of instagram. But all the play and breaking of the instagram rules will not have any impact on the medium. 

Mediums like painting for example have standards that have been co-created over a very long time; and any artist can propose new conventions or variations on a standard. Whether these are adopted or not depends on a multitude of factors, but we can still see the medium as a result of a collective effort. 

Working to the frame on instagram is labour because none of your edits or playful things will have an effect on the medium. There is also a temporal nature to the frame of instagram; that dictates an optimal posting frequency. While never specified, users have deduced an optimal frequency of 1-2 posts per day. This frame of frequency further defines what the platoform wants, and what is possible to produce in that timeframe. 

If we look at successful artist accounts on instagram, we see lots of creative coders producing daily animations. Even the idea of the 'daily' production seems closely linked to social media platforms. I suppose we're bumping up against the idea that art should be intuitive and whatever the artists wants it to be, rather than formed to meet a demand. From this perspective, certain artists have intuitive drives that bring them to starting points that are closer to what the audience desires; others might have to shift their practice a little bit to remain relevant. 

I don't know if there is a problem with this shift; from one perspective artists need audiences, but the icky side of it is the role of the plaftorm; to what degree has it formed the attentional norms of it's audiences, and hence the scope of output for its creators? 

As I write this I think of Janne Richardsen, who creates very short and simple destruction videos on instagram. He speaks of his work in the tradition of peformance art, and his references do support this. But his viral success on instagram seems to undermine his credibility as a 'serious' artist. To what degree did he shift his practice to fit the form of instagram? And what have the rewards been? It's clear that there is an audience for the work, which derive pleasure from the videos. 

But this audience is perhaps the same who watch the 5-minute craft videos with strange introductions; an audience that will accept any video with a simple narrative hook. And is this a problem? Not really, but I guess there is an idea of art being more special. Of art not needing to bend to it's audience, of art lifting up it's audience. 

I sometimes think that I should just try to make work that sells, because that is what the current world values. Why should an artist try to avoid that system? You can see that with the NFT world, where people are making relative garbage but still getting money for it. Why is that useful or valuable? 

So I guess there are few conclusions to draw; that working to the frame of a platform is inevitably a compromise, but that value can come out of it too. But that we need to be aware of what we are letting shape our creation. I guess this is the reason that there is a general aversion in the arts to thinking about or making money. Because money is such a strong lever that if it gets into the works you're just producing work, you're not making anything with a transcendent potential. And that is also maybe the challenge of producing good work for a full career; that at some point, the money becomes too powerful, and you bow to the demands. 

This makes me think of an anecdote from abigail disney, who said that for all the billionaires she knows, she asked them how much money they'd need to feel secure. they all said they'd need double what they have now. this shows us that the idea of financial freedom is a myth - and that as artists this is just one of the challenges, to resist the siren song of easy money and to keep on the path.
